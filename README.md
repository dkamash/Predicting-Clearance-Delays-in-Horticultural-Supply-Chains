# Project Title: Predictive Analytics for Optimizing "Time-to-Export" Lead Times in Kenya’s Horticultural Supply Chain
![horticulture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae3e540a-07e4-4602-b5e6-1f6a71e76238)

## 1.0 Introduction

This project develops a machine learning solution to predict the **time-to-export** (total lead time from packhouse/farm to final departure at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport — JKIA or Mombasa Port) for Kenya’s horticultural exports — primarily cut flowers, fruits, and vegetables.

The goal is to help exporters anticipate delays, reduce post-harvest losses, improve cold-chain planning, negotiate better freight contracts, and enhance overall supply chain resilience in one of Kenya’s most critical foreign exchange earning sectors.

## 2.0 Research Problem & Objectives

### Problem Statement

Kenya’s horticulture sector faces chronic and worsening logistics challenges including:

- Severe airfreight capacity shortages and skyrocketing costs at JKIA
- Frequent customs clearance delays and electronic system failures
- Port congestion and slow turnaround at Mombasa
- External disruptions (weather events, strikes, global shipping crises, ad hoc levies)

These bottlenecks result in substantial spoilage (especially for highly perishable products), missed market windows (particularly in Europe), and multi-billion-shilling revenue losses annually.

Currently, most exporters rely on experience-based estimates rather than reliable, data-driven predictions.

### Main Objective

To develop a robust, accurate machine learning regression model that predicts total export lead time (in hours or days) for Kenyan horticultural shipments, enabling proactive planning and risk mitigation.

### Specific Objectives

- Load and inspect the 5,000-record consignment dataset  
- Perform initial data exploration and quality checks  
- Conduct descriptive analytics: overall delay rate, processing times, and key distributions  
- Identify delay patterns by origin/destination, commodity, time/day, and ports  
- Uncover early red-flag signals (document completeness, amendments, congestion)  
- Build and evaluate a baseline Random Forest Classifier for delay prediction  
- Visualize insights and model performance (classification report, confusion matrix)


### Stakeholders

* International freight forwarders
* Customs & port operators
* Exporters of perishable commodities
* Supply chain analytics teams

### Project Scope

  - Loading and basic exploration of the  dataset

  - Additional algorithms (XGBoost, etc.)
  - Model deployment or dashboard

## 3.0 Data Understanding

**3.1 Dataset Overview**

The dataset consists of 5,000 synthetic but realistic international consignments, stored in JSON Lines format .  
Each record represents a single shipment (mostly air freight of perishable goods such as fruits and cut flowers) and contains information about origin/destination, commodity, weight, document status, congestion, processing times, and whether the shipment was delayed beyond its SLA.

File: tlip_like_consignments_5000.jsonl  
Records: 5,000  
Columns: 27  
No missing values across the entire dataset

**3.2 Loading the Data**

The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame using:


df = pd.read_json("tlip_like_consignments_5000.jsonl", lines=True)
df.head(5)

**Primary anticipated sources include:**
- KenTrade Single Window (TradeNet) — clearance times, permit records
- KNBS (Kenya National Bureau of Statistics) — monthly/quarterly export statistics
- AFA Horticultural Crops Directorate & KEPHIS — export volumes & phytosanitary certificates
- External event data — weather records, port/airport disruptions, freight cost trends

- **Lowest delay** (all AIR): Fresh Beans (41%), Mangoes (43%), Cut Flowers/Herbs (~44%)
- SEA shipments consistently 2–3× more delayed than AIR


### 5.6. Early Red-Flag Signals (Pre-Clearance Predictors)

**5.6.1 Document Completeness Score**  
- Very High (0.9–1.0): **38%** delay rate, 93.18h avg processing  
- High (0.7–0.9): **63%** delay rate, 106.10h avg processing  
→ Higher completeness → much lower risk (strong negative correlation)

**5.6.2 Number of Document Amendments**  
- 0 amendments: **37%** delay rate  
- 1 amendment: **58%**  
- 2 amendments: **78%**  
- 3+ amendments: **93%** delay rate  
→ Each amendment is a major red flag (positive correlation)

**5.6.3 Congestion Index**  
- Low (0–0.3): **26%** delay rate  
- Medium (0.3–0.5): **46%**  
- High (0.5–0.7): **65%**  
- Very High (0.7–1.0): **78%** delay rate  
→ Strongest single early predictor (positive correlation)

**5.6.4 Weight & Value Quartiles**  
- Heavier/higher-value shipments: slightly higher delay risk (49–51%)

**5.6.5 Correlation Summary** (Early Flags vs Delay)  
- doc_completeness_score: **−0.3361** (strong negative)  
- doc_amendments: **+0.3012**  
- congestion_index: **+0.3793** (highest among early flags)

**5.6.6 Visual Highlights**
- Pie chart: overall delay split (48.4% delayed)
- Bar charts: delay rates by origin/destination, commodity, port, time bucket, day of week, document completeness, amendments, congestion, weight/value
- Histograms & box plots: processing time & delay distributions
- Scatter plots: customs vs dwell time (bottleneck detection), processing time vs delay rate by country
- Trend line: document completeness vs delay (clear downward slope)

**5.6.7 Final Key Takeaways for Modeling**
- **Strongest early red flags**: high congestion, many document amendments, low document completeness  
- **Highest risk profile**: Weekend-created SEA shipments of Tea/Vegetables/Pineapples from Rwanda to Belgium/Germany  
- **Weekend penalty**: nearly doubles delay risk  
- **AIR vs SEA**: AIR shipments are far more reliable  
- Nearly half of consignments delayed — balanced and realistic classification problem
