![horticulture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae3e540a-07e4-4602-b5e6-1f6a71e76238)

## 1.0 Introduction

This project develops a machine learning solution to predict the **time-to-export** (total lead time from packhouse/farm to final departure at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport — JKIA or Mombasa Port) for Kenya’s horticultural exports — primarily cut flowers, fruits, and vegetables.

The goal is to help exporters anticipate delays, reduce post-harvest losses, improve cold-chain planning, negotiate better freight contracts, and enhance overall supply chain resilience in one of Kenya’s most critical foreign exchange earning sectors.

## 2.0 Research Problem & Objectives

### Problem Statement

Kenya’s horticulture sector faces chronic and worsening logistics challenges including:

- Severe airfreight capacity shortages and skyrocketing costs at JKIA
- Frequent customs clearance delays and electronic system failures
- Port congestion and slow turnaround at Mombasa
- External disruptions (weather events, strikes, global shipping crises, ad hoc levies)

These bottlenecks result in substantial spoilage (especially for highly perishable products), missed market windows (particularly in Europe), and multi-billion-shilling revenue losses annually.

Currently, most exporters rely on experience-based estimates rather than reliable, data-driven predictions.

### Main Objective

To develop a robust, accurate machine learning regression model that predicts total export lead time (in hours or days) for Kenyan horticultural shipments, enabling proactive planning and risk mitigation.

### Specific Objectives

- Load and inspect the 5,000-record consignment dataset  
- Perform initial data exploration and quality checks  
- Conduct descriptive analytics: overall delay rate, processing times, and key distributions  
- Identify delay patterns by origin/destination, commodity, time/day, and ports  
- Uncover early red-flag signals (document completeness, amendments, congestion)  
- Build and evaluate a baseline Random Forest Classifier for delay prediction  
- Visualize insights and model performance (classification report, confusion matrix)


### Stakeholders

* International freight forwarders
* Customs & port operators
* Exporters of perishable commodities
* Supply chain analytics teams

### Project Scope

  - Loading and basic exploration of the  dataset
  - Data structure & quality check (df.info(), df.describe())

## 3.0 Data Understanding

**3.1 Dataset Overview**

The dataset consists of 5,000 synthetic but realistic international consignments, stored in JSON Lines format .  
Each record represents a single shipment (mostly air freight of perishable goods such as fruits and cut flowers) and contains information about origin/destination, commodity, weight, document status, congestion, processing times, and whether the shipment was delayed beyond its SLA.

File: tlip_like_consignments_5000.jsonl  
Records: 5,000  
Columns: 27  
No missing values across the entire dataset

**3.2 Loading the Data**

The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame using:


df = pd.read_json("tlip_like_consignments_5000.jsonl", lines=True)
df.head(5)

**Primary anticipated sources include:**
- KenTrade Single Window (TradeNet) — clearance times, permit records
- KNBS (Kenya National Bureau of Statistics) — monthly/quarterly export statistics
- AFA Horticultural Crops Directorate & KEPHIS — export volumes & phytosanitary certificates
- External event data — weather records, port/airport disruptions, freight cost trends

- Trend line: document completeness vs delay (clear downward slope)

**5.6.7 Final Key Takeaways for Modeling**
- **Strongest early red flags**: high congestion, many document amendments, low document completeness  
- **Highest risk profile**: Weekend-created SEA shipments of Tea/Vegetables/Pineapples from Rwanda to Belgium/Germany  
- **Weekend penalty**: nearly doubles delay risk  
- **AIR vs SEA**: AIR shipments are far more reliable  
- Nearly half of consignments delayed — balanced and realistic classification problem

- Feature selection strategy (max_features)

**8.1 Tuning balanced:**

- Predictive performance
- Generalization
- Computational efficiency

## 9.0 Model Evaluation.
The model was evaluated using:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

**9.1 Key observations:**

- Random Forest shows better balance between precision and recall
- Recall for delayed shipments improves compared to baseline models
- F1-score confirms better handling of class imbalance

**9.2 Interpretation:**

- The tuned Random Forest model demonstrates strong recall, minimizing false negatives (missed delays), which is critical from a business perspective.

**9.3 Confusion Matrix**

- Fewer false negatives in the final model
- Improved detection of delayed shipments
- Acceptable trade-off in false positives

- Quantify feature contributions
- Improve model transparency and trust

**10.2 SHAP Analysis Provided:**

- Global feature importance: Identifies overall drivers of shipping delays
- Local explanations: Explains why specific shipments were predicted as delayed
- Directionality insights: Shows whether features increase or decrease delay probability

**10.3 Business value:**

- Enables shipment-level accountability and transparency
- Supports auditability and operational trust
