Excellent move. This is exactly how you prevent silent misuse of features and accidental data leakage in a group project.

Below is an expanded, production-grade data dictionary, now with:
	1.	Example values per column
	2.	A modeler cheat sheet
	3.	Explicit feature-safety classification (pre- vs post-outcome)

You can paste this straight into Word / Confluence / Notion.

Data Dictionary – Horticultural Clearance Delay Prediction

Dataset Overview

Each row represents one export consignment.
The objective is to predict whether a consignment will be delayed beyond its SLA using only information available early in the process.

⸻

1. Consignment-Level Dataset (consignments_5000.csv)

Identifiers & Metadata

Column	Description	Example	Safe for Modeling
consignment_id	Unique synthetic consignment identifier	TLIP-SYN-000421	❌ ID only
created_at	Timestamp when consignment was created	2025-03-14T09:22:11	⚠️ (time features only)


⸻

Geography & Routing

Column	Description	Example	Safe
origin_country	Country of export	KE	✅
destination_country	Country of import	NL	✅
origin_port	Export port / airport	Nairobi-JKIA	✅
destination_port	Import port / airport	Schiphol	✅
shipment_mode	Mode of transport	AIR	✅


⸻

Commodity Information

Column	Description	Example	Safe
commodity	Product category	Cut Flowers	✅
hs_code	Harmonized System code	0603	✅


⸻

Cargo & Value Attributes

Column	Description	Example	Safe
gross_weight_kg	Total shipment weight	18250.75	✅
declared_value_usd	Declared shipment value	69423.50	✅


⸻

Exporter & Documentation Quality

Column	Description	Example	Safe
exporter_profile	Exporter size category	SME	✅
doc_completeness_score	Documentation completeness (0–1)	0.91	✅
missing_docs_proxy	Number of missing docs (proxy)	1	✅
doc_amendments	Number of document amendments	2	✅


⸻

Operational Conditions

Column	Description	Example	Safe
congestion_index	Port congestion level (0–1)	0.63	✅
is_weekend_created	Weekend indicator (1/0)	0	✅


⸻

⚠️ Process Timing (Post-Outcome Signals)

These must NOT be used as input features for prediction models.
They represent outcomes or near-outcomes.

Column	Description	Example	Safe
customs_release_hours	Time taken for customs clearance	31.4	❌
terminal_dwell_hours	Time at terminal post-clearance	54.7	❌
total_processing_hours	Total clearance duration	86.1	❌


⸻

Targets / Labels

Column	Description	Example	Safe
sla_hours	Expected clearance SLA	60	❌
delayed_flag	Target variable (1 = delayed)	1	❌
delay_hours	Hours beyond SLA buffer	14.2	❌


⸻

Reference Numbers

Column	Description	Example	Safe
bl_or_awb_no	Bill of Lading / Air Waybill	176-89374652	❌
container_no	Container ID (SEA only)	MSKU8293412	❌


⸻

2. Document-Level Dataset (documents_5000.csv)

Column	Description	Example	Safe
consignment_id	Parent consignment	TLIP-SYN-000421	⚠️ Join key
doc_type	Document type	commercial_invoice	⚠️
doc_id	Document reference	INV-KE-482931	❌
is_present	Document exists (1/0)	1	⚠️ (aggregated only)
created_at	Document creation time	2025-03-14T10:01:02	❌
amendments_count	Number of amendments	1	⚠️ (aggregated only)


⸻

3. Event-Level Dataset (events_5000.csv)

Column	Description	Example	Safe
consignment_id	Parent consignment	TLIP-SYN-000421	❌
event	Process milestone	CUSTOMS_RELEASE	❌
timestamp	Event time	2025-03-16T18:22:41	❌
location	Event location	Mombasa	❌
mode	Shipment mode	SEA	❌

Event data is for analysis and storytelling, not predictive features.

MODELERS’ CHEAT SHEET

✅ Safe Feature Groups (Use These)
	•	Shipment mode
	•	Commodity & HS code
	•	Origin & destination
	•	Exporter profile
	•	Document completeness & amendment counts
	•	Congestion index
	•	Weekend indicator
	•	Weight & declared value

❌ Do NOT Use (Data Leakage)
	•	Clearance time variables
	•	Terminal dwell time
	•	SLA, delay flags, delay hours
	•	Event timestamps after clearance
	•	Any post-customs information

⸻

🎯 Recommended Feature Set (Baseline)

shipment_mode
commodity
hs_code
origin_country
destination_country
exporter_profile
doc_completeness_score
missing_docs_proxy
doc_amendments
congestion_index
is_weekend_created
gross_weight_kg
declared_value_usd

Key Modeling Guidance
	•	Treat this as an early-warning prediction, not a forensic analysis.
	•	Favor interpretability first, then performance.
	•	If a feature wouldn’t be known before clearance, don’t use it.
	•	When in doubt: ask whether the exporter would know this at submission time.

⸻

If you want next, I can:
	•	Convert this into a Word-ready data dictionary
	•	Add example SQL joins between tables
	•	Create a one-page “DO / DON’T” slide for your team
	•	Annotate features by business vs operational ownership

This is the kind of rigor that quietly separates strong projects from average ones.
